Description
This code combines GitBook's 3. Code along(Simple website) and 4.Challenges (Codecademy Challenges: Challenge #5) of the Further Resources" to create a simple parallax page. It uses very basic HTML and CSS to achieve this effect.

## Main Features

This is the main HTML file for Project 1 focused on HTML & CSS. It includes:

- Header: Contains a logo and a navigation bar with hover effects on the links.
- External Link: An external link or button that might lead to more resources or actions (though not included in the provided code).
- Image: A logo image included in the header.
- Unordered List: Navigation menu items listed as an unordered list in the header.
- Parallax Scrolling: Sections with a parallax effect achieved through CSS, creating a sense of depth as the user scrolls.
- Content Sections: Various content sections interspersed with parallax backgrounds for visual interest.

## HTML Structure

1. Header Section: Features a logo image and a navigation menu with links.
2. Parallax Sections: Several sections with parallax scrolling backgrounds that stay fixed while the content scrolls over them.
3. Content Sections: Standard sections with text and headings.

This setup demonstrates the basic implementation of parallax scrolling using HTML and CSS, incorporating essential elements like headers, navigation, and content sections for a functional and visually engaging webpage.
